hi guys in this video we are going to - discuss most important managerial round
questions and their solutions this is -same for different it companies this is - not for a specific company okay

so our first question is what you have
What have you done to optimize or improve your workspace?
 done to optimize or improve your

workspace so you can say like that that
in our code base one function was

hitting database again and again which

was making our system slow so what we

did was we used hash map to store the

results and used to hit database only if

the value is

not present in hash map this way we

optimize our workspace

so the next question is what are your
What are your strength and weakness?

strength and weakness -for i know that for strength part

everybody can say something but for - weakness you have to say in such a way -that it seems as your strength for

weakness you can say that i used to take
little bit more time in understanding - the requirement specification i used to
ask lot of why and how - but this eventually helps me in finding
optimized solution at the end- 
this will make your interviewer very- happy that this person is very much
concerned about requirement specification

Have you been in any conflict

now the next question is have you been

ever in any conflict how did you resolve it

my suggestion to all of you is that you - have to say yes even if you did not face

it will put a positive impact okay- you can say like that in my team a task
was given to one of my team member to update

what is the status of different team members at the end of the day
after asking from them

but - he missed few days
unfortunately and that created a conflict
so what i did was i called a meeting
with all the members
and understood his problem
and then we decided that we will write
our part in a blank sheet and send it to him
after that he will consolidate everything
and finally draft an email

What you did when you commit any mistake
now the next question is what you did

when you commit any mistake now my

suggestion is to say yes even if you do not have done any mistake
first you can say like that first i

called my team lead and just accepted my

mistake this shows your flexibility

then you can say that i explained him

the effects of this mistake

you can say that then i explained him

how to resolve it and then documented

that mistake

so that nobody commit that mistake again

this question will put you in front seat
How did you help your team member

now the next question they can ask you

like that how did you help your team

member if he is not performing up to the

mark you can say like that
first i have scheduled a meeting with him

tried to understand his problem

i found that he was struggling in

springboot then i suggested him few

links of youtube videos
then i used to sit with him for 20

minutes after office hours to understand

his doubts
finally he improved and got 4 rating in
final appraisal

this shows your leadership quality
Latest recognition from your manager

now the next question is have you got
any latest recognition from your manager
even if you have not you have to say yes
you can say like that when most of
senior members were absent i handled the
client for one week
you can say that i did my best and got
best appraisal from my manager
this will shows you that you care for a manager and this is all they want

so that's all from my guys
